      The purpose of this website is to give glory and honor to the LORD of LORDâ€™s and the King of Kings, Jesus Christ. There is no organized religious connection and no denomination affiliation with this web site or any of its content. The singular reason for this site is to give correct and truthful answers to questions we all have in life. Also, simply for a consistent reference point we will be using the Scofield NIV bible. cross-references will be through the king James, new King James and the Torah. Along with some Greek, Hebrew and Latin translations of words and word types. We hope and pray as you seek answers in your life that God would draw you close to himself through the grace and truth of his son Jesus Christ.
